## üëã Welcome to the CustomNPC+ Repository.
![](images/logo.png)  

> CustomNPC+ is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod that allows you to add custom NPCs to your world. It is developed for creative and storytelling players who want to make their Minecraft worlds more in-depth and unique. CustomNPC+ is only a branch version of the **1.7.10** Forge version of the original (down below) and has no plans to add or update any other version. This is not an official version of CustomNPC.

### ‚ùó Notice
I am not the original creator of CustomNPC. The original creator is @[Noppes](https://github.com/Noppes). I have been permitted to update the 1.7.10 and post my results on GitHub. The original mod that is updated to the latest versions of Minecraft can be found on these links: [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/custom-npcs), [kodevelopment](http://www.kodevelopment.nl/minecraft/customnpcs)

### üîπ Installation
This mod is an ***update*** to CustomNPC and not an add-on. Do not install CustomNPC with CustomNPC-Plus. CustomNPC-Plus does not remove any functional features from the original mod. It expands upon CustomNPC with original features and backported features from newer versions. Simply drag CustomNPC-Plus into any client/server mods folder to utilize. Please **backup** before using as this could still have unforeseen errors. Report any bugs if found, thank you and enjoy.
